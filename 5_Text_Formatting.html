    <p> <b>Data science</b> is an interdisciplinary academic fields<sup>[1]</sup> that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processing, scientific visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
    <p>Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine).<sup>[3]</sup> Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.<sup>[4]</sup></p>

    <p>Data science is "a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.<sup>[5]</sup> It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge.<sup>[6]</sup> However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.<sup>[7][8]</sup></p>
