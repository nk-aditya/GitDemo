HTML (hyper text markup language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page and consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display content.

Tags:
  < > : opening tag
  </ > : closing tag 
  < /> : self-closing tag

Basic Structure of an HTML Document:
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
    <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </body>
 </html>

In this structure:
- The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines the document type and version of HTML.
- The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page.
- The <head> element contains meta-information about the document, such as the title.
- The <title> element specifies the title of the document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
- The <body> element contains the content of the document, such as headings, paragraphs,images, links, etc. In this example, we have a heading (h1) and a paragraph (p) within the body of the document.


Comments in HTML are added using the following syntax:
- <!-- This is a comment --> Comments are not displayed in the browser and are used to explain the code or provide additional information for developers.
